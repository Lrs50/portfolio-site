            I am Lucas Reis, a Computer Engineering graduate from the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE). 
            Originally from Bahia, I moved to Recife to advance my academic and professional journey in technology.
            <br/><br/>
            I have a solid background in data science and MLOps, with experience in data collection, processing, model development, 
            and deployment. My academic experience includes research in 5G networks in collaboration with CIN/Motorola and work on 
            quantum neural networks through a PIBIC scholarship. I also served as Vice President of the Quantum Computing League (LACIQ), 
            fostering research and industry connections.
            <br/><br/>
            Currently I focus on developing scalable data pipelines, building predictive models, and integrating machine learning 
            systems into production environments. I intend to pursue a masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science with a focus on time series forecasting.
