            "I have a solid background in data science and MLOps, with experience in data collection, processing, model development, and deployment. My academic experience includes research in 5G networks in collaboration with CIN/Motorola and work on quantum neural networks through a PIBIC scholarship. I also served as Vice President of the Quantum Computing League (LACIQ), fostering research and industry connections.",
            "Currently I focus on developing scalable data pipelines, building predictive models, and integrating machine learning systems into production environments. I intend to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on time series forecasting."
